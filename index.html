                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><large>My Background</large></strong>
                <p>I am born and raised in Austin, Texas.  After high school I began working in
                    banking.  I have worked in a number of different roles in the front and back office and presently
                    work in the operations area of a major local Credit Union.  I have taken a number of courses in finance and technology
                    on my own.  The most recent technology course years ago was on using computer aided drafting for integrated
                    circuit layout and design.  I presently enjoy spending my non working hours with my wife and daughter together helping our community.

                <p>I love to travel, spend time in nature and experience new foods and outdoor activities.  I also enjoy fitness
                    training and hanging out with friends and family to play board or video games.  I also find learning highly
                    enjoyable and will just a likely listen to an article over text to speech than music when I am driving around.

                <strong><large>What brings me to software engineering</large></strong>
                <p>I've always enjoyed playing with technology.  I remember in elementary school getting to use a
                    simple program to make a colored line go across the screen and playing the old school oregon
                    trail video game.  I've always been interested in what tech jobs were like and at home I love to
                    tinker with apps, smart devices and using programs to help me learn more faster.  I am hoping that 
                    learnig code will allow me to better understand the things I deal with and give me a marketable
                    transferable skill I can use to find a technology job that will allow me to learn more and provide
                    more time with and opportunities for my family. I found Coding Temple through Career Karma and found the
                    bootcamp idea for a career change very interesting.  With a full time job and family it was very important
                    I find a program with a minimum amount of hours I can follow weekly and strong support to bridge the gap
                    between self taught and an in person camp that I don't have time for.
